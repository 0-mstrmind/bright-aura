Bright Aura - Streetlight monitoring system web dashboard is implemented here for "Hack The Winter (Round-1)" consisting:
- Admin/Partner Login System (Role based)
- Dashboard to manage/monitor streetlight status in real-time
- Auto location fetch & location search, auto data fetching from system for fast updates in real-time
- Role based management access eg: Admin can manage partners (revoke or grant access)
- core web functionality like reset password, etc

## Rund 2 Extention (To Do in NextJS)
- Add other monitoring functionality with streetlight monitoring in the web eg: gov. service active for current date or not?, to save time
- using custom auto fetch via api or custom tech same as Streetlight Monitoring System (Hardware/Crowd gathered updates)
